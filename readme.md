# 4Chan.js thread scrapper

This is currently a work in progress and barely works with almost no error handling. DO NOT USE

    -f : Specify a folder where you want to save your images
    -e : specify a file format you don't want to download (ex: -e gif)
    --noanimation : doesn't download gifs and webms
    -u : url of the thread

## What it can currently do :
    - Download all images and webms from a thread
    - Exclude by one or multiple patterns
    - Not much else

## What will it do in the futur :
    - Download depending on file size
    - Easily automate scrapping

## What it will never do:
    - Coffee, sadly
    - Scrap other websites
    - Scrap entire boards
