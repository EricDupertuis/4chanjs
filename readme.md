# 4Chan.js, Javascript image scrapper // Node.js powered

This is currently a work in progress and barely works with almsot no error handling.

    -f : Specify a folder where you want to save your images

## What it can currently do :
    - Download all images and webms from a thread
    - Not much else

## What will it do in the futur :
    - Exclude by patterns (wip)
    - Download depending on file size
    - Easily automate scrapping
    
## What it will never do:
    - Coffee, sadly
    - Scrap other websites
    - Scrap entire boards
